Status of Various Browsers as of 2010-03-08T18:55:07+0000

Internet Explorer

  Version 5.5 and lower
  	These versions of IE just don't support the kinds of things
	that we require for the application, so they will not be
	supported.

  Version 6.0.2900.2180 SP2
  	The grid and unit tests fully pass, but the tree has issues
	due to the lack of proper CSS support.  Also, the grid has
	some display issues, but it is functional.  Hopefully, we
	won't have to actually support this version of the browser for
	the heavy-duty, interactive controls.

  Version 7.0.5730.11 SP2
	All unit tests pass in this browser, but the display issues
	are similar, yet different, to the ones in IE6.  Editing
	doesn't automatically expand the cell width, and the CSS
	styles for the grid control are not rendered.

	The tree has the same problems as IE6, so hopefully, we won't
	have to come up with a special set of hacks to support these
	versions of IE.

Firefox

  Version 2.0.0.4 and lower
  	This version of firefox has issues running the unit tests, but
	it does display the browser correctly.  However, interaction
	with the controls does not currently work.

	There is currently no support planned for this browser.

  Version 3.6.2 daily
  	Introduction of a display glitch in the first row of the tree
	data last week, but otherwise seems to be fine.

Opera

  Version 10.10 on Linux
  	All seems to work as expected.

Safari

  Version 3.2.2 (525.28.1) on Windows
  	All works as expected.

Chrome

  Version 4.0.249.89 (38071) on Windows
  	All works as expected.
